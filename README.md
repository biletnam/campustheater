CampusTheater
=============

A site to help campuses manage vibrant theater and performing arts communities

== TODOs
- Modules need to be setup for the front-page to be layed out
- play with poster sizing more as we get experience (background-size 100%, use ratio, etc.)
- Errors and validation errors should be handled better. No messages given often! (last showtime deletion, etc.)

- Loading spinner on poster upload
- Freshmen and Playground tables need to be enhanced into Rails
- See internal code TODOs
